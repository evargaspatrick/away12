Welcome to the shadows, gumshoe. Before you hit the streets chasing down Coach Marlowe, let's get you up to speed on moving around in this murky world.

Your toolkit for navigating these dimly lit alleys and rooms is built on a few simple commands—think of 'em as your detective's instincts.

Search: Your bread and butter for combing through rooms, lockers, and any nooks that might hide clues. If there's something to be found, this action will snag it for you, tossing it straight into your inventory.

Investigate: Got a clue, a piece of the puzzle, or a person of interest? Use this to take a closer look. Anything picked up with a search gets its secrets spilled with a good investigation,
and chatting up the locals can sometimes pry loose the truth you're chasing.

Move: When it's time to change scenery, this command walks you through doors and into new mysteries. The exits? They're always laid out clear at the foot of your screen.

Stick to these basics, and you'll be on the right track. And remember, in this game of shadows, a keen eye and a sharper wit are your best allies. Good hunting, Detective Malone.

Welcome to the shadows, gumshoe. Before you hit the streets chasing down Coach Marlowe, let's get you up to speed on moving around in this murky world.

Your toolkit for navigating these dimly lit alleys and rooms is built on a few simple commands—think of 'em as your detective's instincts.

Search: Your bread and butter for combing through rooms, lockers, and any nooks that might hide clues. If there's something to be found, you'll see it with that keen eye of yours.

Interact: Found a clue, a piece of the puzzle, or a person of interest you wanna talk to? Use this to take a closer look or have a chat. A good detective can piece together the
puzzle with yesterday's newspaper from off the street, and a great detective knows how to pry the truth loose from tight lipped locals or POIs
(that means persons of interests for you small-time wannabes).

Forward: Allows you to move to the next room, smooth sailing ahead, like greased lightning.

Back: Allows you to move back to the previous room, it's as easy as pie.

Inventory: This holds the items you had picked up to investigate after searching a room or location. Don't worry, with the trench coat you're wearing,
holding everything isn't a bother, it's a breeze.

Previous: This button is in case you missed something that was said, in case you're not up to snuff. You can go back and read again, and maybe this time
you'll Get it through your thick skull.

Stick to these basics, and you'll be on the right track. And remember, in this game of shadows, a keen eye and a sharper wit are your best allies.
Good hunting, Detective Malone.
