Welcome to the shadows, gumshoe. Before you hit the streets chasing down Coach Marlowe, let's get you up to speed on moving around in this murky world.

Your toolkit for navigating these dimly lit alleys and rooms is built on a few simple commandsâ€”think of 'em as your detective's instincts.

Search: Your bread and butter for combing through rooms, lockers, and any nooks that might hide clues. If there's something to be found, this action will snag it for you, tossing it straight into your inventory.

Investigate: Got a clue, a piece of the puzzle, or a person of interest? Use this to take a closer look. Anything picked up with a search gets its secrets spilled with a good investigation,
and chatting up the locals can sometimes pry loose the truth you're chasing.

Move: When it's time to change scenery, this command walks you through doors and into new mysteries. The exits? They're always laid out clear at the foot of your screen.

Stick to these basics, and you'll be on the right track. And remember, in this game of shadows, a keen eye and a sharper wit are your best allies. Good hunting, Detective Malone.
