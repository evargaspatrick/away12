Gridiron City. A light rain taps rhythmically against the window of a gritty downtown office.

Upon further inspection, this is the office of Detective Jack 'The Shadow' Malone.

Malone, is a seasoned investigator known for solving complex cases. Although, Malone doesn't actually work for the GPD anymore, they refuse to fire him officially, leaving his office intact, and he never officially quit.

So he's a detective forever in limbo. While sitting at his desk, surrounded by scattered files, and a flickering lamp.

The phone on his desk, suddenly begins to ring.

Upon picking up the phone, Richard Miles speaks in a panic.

Richard: Hello, is this Detective Jack Malone? This is Richard Miles from Gridiron Sports Commission. Listen, we need your help it's dire. We've looked all over and still can't find Coach Marlowe!.

Jack remains silent for a moment.

Jack: You sure Marlowe isn't staying out of the publics eye to calm his nerves?

Richard: I'm sure of it! He's 30 years in the making and is sure to go down as the greatest Coach of all time after this upcoming game! For him to have nerves now is silly.

Richard: Now look, after talking with his wife Evelyn and Vice Coach Brown we found somethings but it aint much. Evelyn said that he never came home yesterday. Which is odd according tos

Evelyn, she said he's a man of routine, never changes or deviates for anything. Vice Coach Browns said he last saw him during the late-night meeting. After the meeting, Coach Marlowe told Browns

he was going to his office to grab something before heading home. That being the last time Browns saw him.

Richard: So what do you say Detective Malone? Will you help Marlowes family, his team, thes commission and the entire league by finding him?

Jack: Let me think about it.

The phone *clicks*

Vincent 'Victory' Marlowe missing three days before the biggest game of the century. If that doesn't seem off I don't what does. His team, the GridIron Gladiators whose current record is 19-0.

The talks of the town is they're about to play against Trumbledale Titans, who are also 19-0 in their respectives divisions.

Looks like I've just been handed a full plate, it's time to get to work.
